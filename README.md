<b>Please note: there will be some unavoidable flickering. This is just the nature of the console; it takes time to print characters.</b>

<h2>How to play:</h2> 
1. Run the file<br>
2. Press space to start the game<br>
3. Press space again to jump. Jumping just before a pipe or naer the ceiling will give a shorter jump to prevent accidental deaths.
